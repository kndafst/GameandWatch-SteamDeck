#Game and Watch Controls

On the SteamDeck I am working to map all of the keys per game and am creating community layouts as I go. If the game is underlined, I have not finished mapping the keys for it yet. If it is not underlined that I should have all of the keys mapped on the steam deck in the community layout tab for controllers, and they are in a clickable list below.
