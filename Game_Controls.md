# Game and Watch Controls

On the SteamDeck I am working to map all of the keys per game and am creating community layouts as I go. If the game is checked, I have finished mapping the keys for it, if it is not checked I'm still working through the mapping process. All of the keys mapped are in the on the SteamDeck controllers in the community layout tab for controllers, and the key bindings are in the list below.
