### Parser settings to play Nintendo Game and SteamDeck games on the SteamDeck

I have no clue why I was inspired to do this, or to put so much time into  this other than the fact that the SteamDeck did not have this functionality by default and I wanted it to be available for everyone. I have no  real affinity towards Game and Watch systems, I remember playing  them and the early Tiger handhelds in the 80s, but asides for my  modern day Super Mario Bros and Legend of Zelda Game and Watch systems, I probably haven't handled a Game and Watch in 35 years.  One day, when I was adding roms to the SteamDeck, I noticed that I had a rom folder for Game and Watch files  so I ported my roms over with the hope of being able to play them on the SteamDeck. After some trial and error, I discovered that the official EmuDeck parser wasn't setup to display Game and Watch files. I've  created the following instructions to help all users fill in the parser information easily with a working game library. 

If you follow the detailed [steps](/Instructions.md), you will be able to play Game and SteamDeck files on the steam deck. 

This system will only work with files that end with .mgw, I do not have instructions yet for the MAME version of these games which start with gnw_ and end in .zip.
